# Project Management Platform

I need a free project management platform to help me with my course project.

The project needs to follow Scrum methodology, so I need a platform that supports it with all its features.

It's a single project: me and my professor, my professor will be the product owner and I will be the Scrum Master and all the rest of dev roles.

The project will be hosted in Azure App Service with a SQLite database, using ASP.NET Blazor Server (monolithic) and C#.

The project requirements, analysis and planning is already done on paper.

The deadline is 5 months from now.

My experience with some repository platforms is:

- GitHub: I use mainly the repository and issues, thanks to education I have pro features. (GitHub is the only one i have with pro features the others are free)
- GitLab: I have used, but only free features.

With other platforms I'm aware of:

- BitBucket
- Azure DevOps
- Jetbrains YouTrack
- Trello
- Jira
- GitHub Projects
- GitLab (and its free devops features)

I have no experience with none of them. Nor Scrum methodology.

My professor is asking the project management to have all Scrum features, like:

- Product Backlog
- Sprint Backlog
- Sprint Planning
- Sprint Review
- Sprint Retrospective
- Burndown Chart
- Velocity Chart
- Etc.

What platform do you recommend me to use? Why?
